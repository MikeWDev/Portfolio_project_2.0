                Welcome to my corner of the web! I'm Micha≈Ç Kocik , a passionate
                full-stack developer with a penchant for crafting robust,
                user-friendly web solutions. With a blend of creativity and
                technical expertise, I thrive on turning ideas into reality
                through elegant code and intuitive design. My journey in the
                world of programming began 5 years ago, and since then, I've
                been on a relentless quest for knowledge and innovation. From
                front-end magic with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to back-end
                mastery with Node.js and databases like MySQL and MongoDB, I've
                honed my skills across the entire development stack.
